# LinkedList
Just a simple implementation of a linked list

In this first stage, this implementation in C++ 11 simply adds elements to a linked list in an ordered way and then provides a way to reverse it.
It simply serves to refresh things up and remember old things.

Any comments of possible improvements are welcome.
